# Drone-Battery-Monitor
I am developing an accurate battery percentage measurement system for the XFly drone with Qubebots. By using analog low-pass filters and measuring current draw, I calculate the battery's electromotive force (EMF), improving the stability and accuracy of flight time predictions.
